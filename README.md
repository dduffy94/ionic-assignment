# Chain Restaurant Information App
My app is a simple information app with 5 pages. 4 of these pages displays the food from a certain chain restaurant e.g McDonalds and it will tell under each food the amount of calories and price range for that food you can expect here in Ireland. The app has a function to switch between pages easily so you can see the next chain restaurant if the first one was not to your taste.

## The aim of this app
The main goal of this app is to make it readily available to young adults of Ireland the number of calories there is in big chain restaurants if they are feeling pickish but are worried about their calorie consumption. A lot of young adults often walk straight into one of these restaurants not realizing what they are consuming or how it will affect their day if they go over their calorie count. This app is here to correct that by making calorie counts for popular foods available.
